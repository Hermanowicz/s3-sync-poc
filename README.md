## Api keys are already down, so don't bother 😎


This template demonstrates how to develop and deploy a simple SQS-based producer-consumer service running on AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework and the [Lift](https://github.com/getlift/lift) plugin. It allows to accept messages, for which computation might be time or resource intensive, and offload their processing to an asynchronous background process for a faster and more resilient system.

## Anatomy of the template

This template defines one function `producer` and one Lift construct - `jobs`. The producer function is triggered by `http` event type, accepts JSON payloads and sends it to a SQS queue for asynchronous processing. The SQS queue is created by the `jobs` queue construct of the Lift plugin. The queue is set up with a "dead-letter queue" (to receive failed messages) and a `worker` Lambda function that processes the SQS messages.

To learn more:

- about `http` event configuration options, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/)
- about the `queue` construct, refer to [the `queue` documentation in Lift](https://github.com/getlift/lift/blob/master/docs/queue.md)
- about the Lift plugin in general, refer to [the Lift project](https://github.com/getlift/lift)
- about SQS processing with AWS Lambda, please refer to the official [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html)



### Bundling dependencies

In case you would like to include 3rd party dependencies, you will need to use a plugin called `serverless-python-requirements`. You can set it up by running the following command:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements
```

Running the above will automatically add `serverless-python-requirements` to `plugins` section in your `serverless.yml` file and add it as a `devDependency` to `package.json` file. The `package.json` file will be automatically created if it doesn't exist beforehand. Now you will be able to add your dependencies to `requirements.txt` file (`Pipfile` and `pyproject.toml` is also supported but requires additional configuration) and they will be automatically injected to Lambda package during build process. For more details about the plugin's configuration, please refer to [official documentation](https://github.com/UnitedIncome/serverless-python-requirements).
